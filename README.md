# FOSS Funders ([fossfunders.com](https://fossfunders.com/))

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fossfunders/fossfunders.com/main/slice.jpg">

The goal of [FOSS Funders](https://fossfunders.com/) is to **make it weird for
companies _not_ to support Free and Open Source software** (FOSS). The strategy
is to a) develop, share, and iterate on frameworks that we use to drive funding
into the ecosystem, and b) provide social validation by collecting logos in one
place (yay logos! :-).


We link logos to pages where each company can give more details about their
FOSS funding program. If we simply link to GHS or OC profiles, that doesn't add
much value over what GitHub and Open Collective already do (or should be doing
better, they need leaderboards or some such). What we're looking to encourage
here is for each company to say in their own voice how they approach this
topic, so that we can learn from each other and best practices can emerge.

We are specifically looking for financial donations to Open Source projects.
Gift-in-kind and upstream contribution and other programs are great! To be
linked on FOSS Funders you must also support projects with direct financial
contributions.

Levels of link awesomeness:

1. ~A tweet/post is fine to start.~ (*We're no longer accepting these but still have some on the site.*)
1. Even better is a blog post about why this is important to your company, how
   you are approaching the topic, why you picked the projects you did, what
   platforms you are using, maybe plans for the future, etc.
1. The best is a permanent page somewhere on a domain of yours that describes
   your funding program in detail.
